## Hello I'm Angie! 

# Introduction
*********************************************************************************** 

## College Experience
I've taken previous IT college courses.

## Computer Experience
I've had jobs in the computing industry.

## Why are you in this class?
To be able to write security-related scripts and automate IoT devices.

## What might prevent success in an IT class
I need to read the chapters, listen while in class and ask questions otherwise 
I might not do well in the course.

## The most important thing in life
Being **honest**, **kind** and **finding happiness** each day is the most important thing.

## Interests
I enjoy travel. _(But not to cold climates!)_  <br/>
One of the most useful sites for travel planning is [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/).
