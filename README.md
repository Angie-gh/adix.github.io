**College Experience**<br/>
I've taken previous IT college courses.

**Computer Experience**<br/>
I've had jobs in the computer industry.

**Reason for taking the class**<br/>
To be able to write security-related scripts and automate IoT devices.

**What might prevent success in an IT class**<br/>
I need to read the chapters, listen while in class and ask questions otherwise 
I might not do well in the course.

**The most important thing in life**<br/>
Being **honest**, **kind** and **finding happiness** each day is the most important thing.

**Interests**<br/>
I enjoy travel. _(But not to cold climates!)_  <br/>
