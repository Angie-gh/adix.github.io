# This is Internet of Things (IoT) 

**Example of one of my first IoT python scripts.
<br/>It utilizes a potentiometer on a breadboard to demonstrate how the dial can increase/decrease the flashing LED:**
```
from microbit import *

while True:
    potVal = pin2.read_analog()
    pin0.write_digital(1)
    sleep(potVal)
    pin0.write_digital(0)
    sleep(potVal)
```
